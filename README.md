# IOT_DeviceManagement
In this project, I’ve simulated data coming from various devices. The app allows users to add new devices and homes, and it retrieves data from these devices. To simulate incoming data, I’ve set up a cron job that randomly generates data and saves it to the database, which is then displayed on a dashboard.
